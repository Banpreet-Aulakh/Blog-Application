# Yet Another "Amazing" Blog App

Oh, you thought I didn't know how to do web dev? Well I didn't either. But here's an attempt. This is a "blog" app that I've made from scratch (yeah, I know we don't do much of that these days). Is it good? Absolutely not. Was it fun to make? NOPE. But, it's like a right of passage for me tbh. Anyway, here's the obligatory README

## What This Monstrosity Does

This revolutionary piece of software does what approximately 14 million other blog applications do, but with more questionable design choices:

1. **Post Creation** - Write your deepest thoughts or what you had for lunch. It's your blog, I'm not judging (much).
   
2. **Post Viewing** - See all your posts on the home page, because scrolling endlessly through your own content is apparently therapeutic.

3. **Post Update/Delete** - Made a typo? Overshared after that third coffee? Edit or delete your posts with our minimally-tested features.

4. **Responsive Design** - Looks *almost* acceptable on both your desktop and phone. I call that a win.

5. **Post Using Location** - Share your posts with a touch of geography! Automatically tag your posts with your current location (if you allow it, of course). Because nothing says "privacy" like broadcasting where you are.

6. **Post Using Weather** - Ever wanted to share your thoughts along with the current weather? Now you can! Automatically tag your posts with the local weather conditions (if you allow it). Because nothing complements a rant like knowing itâ€™s raining outside.

## Technical Stuff For People Who Care

### Deliverables:
* One Node.js project doing all the heavy lifting (and occasionally dropping it)
* At least one EJS file structuring the website (because plain HTML wasn't complicated enough)
* At least one CSS file making things pretty (or at least less ugly)

## How To Use This Thing

1. Clone this repository (if you really want to)
2. Run `npm install` and pray it works
3. Start the server with `npm start`
4. Question your life choices
5. Visit `localhost:3000` in your browser
